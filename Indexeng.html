		<h2>Valorant</h2>
		<p>Valorant is a first-person shooter game developed by Riot Games with 2 teams of 5 people in which one team must plant a bomb called <em>‚Äúspike‚Äù</em> and the other team must avoid it or defuse it in time in case it gets planted. Both teams switch sides at the half of the match, attackers become defenders and vice versa.</p>
		<p>It is a great example of esports, from the start of its beta phase on April 7, 2020 and later the final version on June 2 of the same year, its great potential as an esport was seen, which continued to improve until it won in 2022 the award for best esport of the year, dethroning League of Legends, a game created by the same company and which had been at the top of esports for years.</p>
